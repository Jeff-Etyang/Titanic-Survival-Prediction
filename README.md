# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a dataset containing information about the passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal is to create a machine learning model that accurately classifies passengers as survivors or non-survivors. This project serves as a practical introduction to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with popular machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes various features about the passengers, such as:
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
